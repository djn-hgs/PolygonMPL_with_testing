# Complete the .distance method of Coord to find the Cartesian distance between 2 Coords
#	Install pytest and write a test function to create two points and check that the distance between them is correct.
#	Write the .perimeter method of the Polygon by summing the cartesian distances between successive points.
#	Again write a test function to test the distance.
#	Complete the __init_ method for the Triangle subclass by calling the super() command.
#	Write a .area method for the Triangle class that will calculate the area using Heronâ€™s formula.
